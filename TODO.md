  - Separate "crop" & "extend" scenarios with Tabs, for example.
- Convert format config: SP: Which level to take.
- Drag-n-drop open files
  - Desktop: cannot handle from backend to get real file path
- Demo path visualization
  - Impossible without gameplay simulation. Only if SO will provide a path
    actually walked.
- Tooltips with interactive content support.
- specports
  - edit whole DB as text
  - limit dialog height, add scroll to sortable list
- footer info: is std, why not

### Desktop

- Single instance: activate primary instance in better way.
- Windows file types association.

## Wishes from users (unsorted)

- "Show border" option from Megaplex? (but it may cause confusion, so it must
  look different in both states).
- The possibility to select a different tile for each mouse button (for example
  empty right button and hardware left button, the middle button could perhaps
  display a floating menu with the list of all the tiles that appear in the
  position where the click is made).
- Level region clipboard persistent (t.i. store selection region in every opened
  level buffer).
  - Control Selection state with undo history. It should let selection editors
    to work more intuitive.
- Clickable "electron" icon to include/exclude n\*9 infotrons needed.
- BIN demo export/import?
- Reorder levels in file
- Replace enh:
  - multiple "find"
  - random "replacement"
- Random: limit 30 is not enough - try use number input
- Lock for a file - make an opened file read-only
- 100% offline with level testing and demo replay?
  - Need run game engine and own offline renderer

### Desktop

- Dir tree
