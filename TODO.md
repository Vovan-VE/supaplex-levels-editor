## Wishes from users (unsorted)

- "Show border" option from Megaplex? (but it may cause confusion, so it must
  look different in both states).
- The possibility to select a different tile for each mouse button (for example
  empty right button and hardware left button, the middle button could perhaps
  display a floating menu with the list of all the tiles that appear in the
  position where the click is made).
- Level region clipboard persistent (t.i. store selection region in every opened
  level buffer).
  - Control Selection state with undo history. It should let selection editors
    to work more intuitive.
- Clickable "electron" icon to include/exclude n\*9 infotrons needed.
- BIN demo export/import?
- MPX/SP signature.

### Desktop

- Dir tree
