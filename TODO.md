# TODO

## Internal

- Toasts.
  - Level title invalid chars.
  - Some errors which now goes to `console.error()`.
  - Internal editing exception from store manipulations.
- Import/export single level.
  - Yet more UI buttons again.
- Tools:
  - Double chip
  - Random
  - Maze
  - Replace
  - Chess
  - Gradient
- Enhance Read Only mode more?
- Visualized level resizing with crop.
  - Separate "crop" & "extend" scenarios with Tabs, for example.

## Wishes from users (unsorted)

- "Show border" option from Megaplex? (but it may cause confusion, so it must
  look different in both states).
- The possibility to select a different tile for each mouse button (for example
  empty right button and hardware left button, the middle button could perhaps
  display a floating menu with the list of all the tiles that appear in the
  position where the click is made).
- Level region clipboard persistent (t.i. store selection region in every opened
  level buffer).
- Clone selection reflected vertically and horizontally in order to facilitate
  the symmetries.
  - UI toolbar, too many buttons, too few space.
- Some additional (temp?) tile selection ways, like "take this specially clicked
  in body tile". Some graphical editors have something similar.
