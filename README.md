[sple.me][sple.me] is **Supaplex Levels Editor** in browser. Inspired by
[Supaplex.Online][spo] and its community.

My previous editor (Winplex Collection Editor â€” WpColEd) is stuck in far 2010 on
Windows. Its source code was lost somewhere in 2016 or about that with HDD
failure. And so, here it is: yet another Supaplex levels editor!

> **SpLE** is under development still. Feel free to report bugs, suggest
> enhancements and correct grammar mistakes.

## Important to know

**SpLE** is completely frontend (client side) application (web page). It works
only with pseudo-files in browser memory.

- After you opened existing file, it becomes in-memory copy of the original
  file. Technically you are uploading your local file to a web page.
- In-memory files you opened or created from scratch are NOT related to regular
  files out of browser.
- To get your modified file back as regular file technically you need to
  download file from web page (with appropriate UI button in **SpLE**).

Also:

- This application uses `indexedDB` and `localStorage` for better user
  experience. These things are similar to well known _Cookies_ in terms of
  privacy.

  **SpLE** will try to remember your modified in-memory files and some
  preferences in browser storage for better user experience.

- There are no intention to send any kind of your data to somewhere without your
  confirmation.

  **SpLE** when completely loaded is operating locally in your browser. Neither
  external storages, nor cross-device sync are implied, nor planned.

  **SpLE** uses [Supaplex.Online test page][spo.test] to test your level when
  you request that.

- DON'T rely much on browser storage to remember your modified in-memory files
  forever. DO SAVE BACKUPS. Browser can clean its storage.

  Also, **SpLE**-related storage in browser can be accidentally reset in case of
  some errors in **SpLE** itself. Because, you know: _Every program has at least
  one bug_.

## Planned features (unsorted)

- More features from Winplex Collection Editor.
- Compare levels.
- End User Manual.
- Draggable files buttons to reorder many opened files.
- Wails based desktop application.
- See more in [TODO](./TODO.md).

## Contribution, Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App][cra].

Ensure to install `husky` git hooks after cloning repository (should be done by
default on `npm ci`).

```sh
git clone ...
cd ...
npm ci

# start development server
npm start

# run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```
